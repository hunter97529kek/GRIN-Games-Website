   <UL>
    <LI>Mouse problems in the interface on Win98/ME fixed.
    <LI>Windows XP Bug that causes random crashes and strange AI behavior involving the System Locale Settings. It is now no longer necessary to set the "Decimal Symbol" to '.'
    <LI>Added a Gamma setting. So far this can only be changed in the Options.txt file by hand. Set it to 0.5 for very dark or up to 6.0 for very bright.
    <LI>Fixed a bug that would cause the Extreme LOD's	to crash on systems without pixel-shader capabilities.
    <LI>The Sharp Reef track should also be working on	all systems now. Reason for the crash was that the High LOD contains per pixel shaded objects, witch it shouldn't... a bit of a copy/paste accident when building the CD...
    <LI>Memory management fix implemented for XP.
    <LI>Problems with sound stuttering and poor quality using Soundblaster Live and Audigy fixed.
    <LI>The game should no longer change your speaker settings to headphones. And yes if you have Quadraphonic speakers they are utilized in the game.
    <LI>The GRIN team has gone back to speeder school as some gamers have reached a top speed of 3217 mph!!!
   </UL>
   <B>FUTURE improvements</B>
   <UL>
    <LI>Voodoo3 patch is in the works
    <LI>Better support for rolling maneuvers using joystick and directional keys on gamepads is in the works.
   </UL>
