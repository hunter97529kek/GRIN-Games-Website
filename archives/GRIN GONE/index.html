<h1>The last Credits from the brothers GRIN</h1>
<div class="small">* 12/08/09 Stockholm, SWEDEN *</div><br /><br />
<div class="tilted">It is with a heavy heart we announce today that GRIN has been forced to close its doors. This as too many publishers have been delaying their payments, causing an unbearable cashflow situation. </div><br />
After twelve years of hard work, employing hundreds of wonderfully talented men and women, it is over. It has been a great adventure and the GRIN family has experienced what few have.  <br /><br />
Looking back at twelve years of games, titles such as <em>Ballistics, Bandits, GRAW 1 & 2, Bionic Commando Rearmed, Wanted: Weapons of Fate, Terminator: Salvation, Bionic Commando</em> and our unreleased masterpiece that we weren’t allowed to finish; it has been a great ride. <br /><br />
We would like to thank a few special companies and individuals that have meant a lot for us during these years:<br /><br />
<em>Phil Scott & Phil Wright</em> and crew at Nvidia<br /><br />
<em>Greg, Chris, Guy, Leigh</em> and crew at Intel<br /><br />
<em>Fabrice, Stephane, Mathieu, Romain, Nouredine</em> and the rest of the team at UBI Soft for the wonderful opportunities on GRAW – you kicked us off, thanks!<br /><br />
The crew at SEB who stood by us at all times<br /><br />
<em>Adam Boyes</em> and the guys at CAPCOM US. Thanks for being honest, a rare gift.<br /><br /><br />
The biggest hug goes to all of our great team members and their families. We had a lot of fun even though we were fighting crazy hours and producers.
<br /><br />
The final thanks goes out to our GRIN mom, <em>Annelie</em> – you stood by us and the company from birth to death – without you none of the great times would have happened. <br /><br /><br />
And to all our gamers – we hope you had a good time.
