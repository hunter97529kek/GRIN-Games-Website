   First off, the walkthrough is available for download in its original and unedited form <A href="skytown_walkthrough.zip">right here</A>.<BR>
   However - as you can see below, <A href="mailto:simonw@grin.se">Grin</A> has edited the walkthrough to make it easier to interpret and so that it fits a webbrowser.<BR>
   A huge thanks goes out to <A href="mailto:speedofsound@gmx.net">SpeedofSound</A> who's tireless (hehe) studies of Ballistics has resulted in this walkthrough, and we hope you enjoy and have much use for the reading.<BR><BR>
   <FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#A6755B"><B>Introduction</B><BR><BR>
   Ballistics is without a doubt the fastest racing game ever. You can achieve speeds you've never dreamed of before. And the most suprising thing is that you will get used to these addictive speeds!<BR>
   Although Ballistics isn't as difficult as it seems first, the learning curve is rather steep for a beginner. It's hard to navigate through a tunnel that apparently misses anything that can be associated with ground or ceiling. Any curve and twist can lead to the left or right, can go up or down depending on your position.<BR>
   Since this game is meant for speed most people tend to accelerate beyond any point of control.<BR>
   The key for mastering this game is a good knowledge of the track you're racing on. No one is able to race constantly at the speed of sound relying only on his reflexes. It's simply impossible.<BR>
   Like any good formula one pilot you have to know every twist and turn. This walkthrough will show you IMHO the easiest, fastest and most efficient way to get through Skytown. It's a good way to familiarize yourself with the position of every obstacle and power up.<BR><BR>
   <FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#A6755B"><B>How to use the download version of the walkthrough</B><BR><BR>
   Unzip all the files into a single folder. The screenshots should be viewed fullscreen and in alphabetical order. Use a program like ACDSee that allows you to go through the pics step by step easily like a slide show or a flip-book.<BR>
   For your convenience print all the text files on paper, so you can watch the screenshots and read the according informations without switching applications.<BR>
   The "road map" provides information about all obstacles and power ups in their order of appearance. Just compare the file name or lap time to determine "where" you are at the moment.<BR>
   Normally there is one screenshot for every object on the track. If there is more than one filename / laptime in the same line it means that all these pictures show the same object at different distances (e.g. pic <A href="javascript: popup_screen('ballistics_wtpics/ballistics_sky08.htm')">08</A> and <A href="javascript: popup_screen('ballistics_wtpics/ballistics_sky09.htm')">09</A>).<BR><BR>
   <FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#A6755B"><B>How to use the online version of the walkthrough</B><BR><BR>
   The whole sequence of screenshots are numbered and put in order together with its accompanying comment and laptime. Click any screenshot to get a popup blowup of it.<BR>
   The popup window has a navigation bar so that you can jump forward and backward in steps of one screenshot at a time through the pictorial sequence.<BR>
   Normally there is one screenshot for every object on the track. If there is more than one picture in the same row it means that all these pictures show the same object at different distances (e.g. pic <A href="javascript: popup_screen('ballistics_wtpics/ballistics_sky08.htm')">08</A> and <A href="javascript: popup_screen('ballistics_wtpics/ballistics_sky09.htm')">09</A>).<BR><BR>
   <FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#A6755B"><B>General notes and tips for navigation</B><BR><BR>
   It is important to know that the movement to the left and right you have to execute is reduced to a minimum. You will position yourself in a way that enables you to "sneak" past several obstacles at maximum speed rather then making big swings around them.<BR>
   If you want to go faster you have to follow the shown positions as close as possible, thus going as near the obstacle as possible without crashing into them.<BR>
   In most cases you won't change your position more than a few degress to the left or right. So if you're in doubt and it isn't mentioned otherwise in the "road map" (the comments), then assume the difference between two pictures in sequence is in fact very small (you just went forward). One example for this is pic <A href="javascript: popup_screen('ballistics_wtpics/ballistics_sky34.htm')">34</A>-<A href="javascript: popup_screen('ballistics_wtpics/ballistics_sky35.htm')">35</A>.<BR>
   Also take a close look at the "curve direction indicator" (CDI). This is the shaded part in the center of your heads-up-display that rotates when you're changing position. The CDI always points in the direction of the outer wall of curve.<BR>
   If you want to stay attached to the track at pro or ballistic difficulty level the CDI should always be between the 2 o'clock and 10 o'clock position, avoiding 12 o'clock. E.g. pic <A href="javascript: popup_screen('ballistics_wtpics/ballistics_sky14.htm')">14</A>-<A href="javascript: popup_screen('ballistics_wtpics/ballistics_sky16.htm')">16</A>: the CDI is at 10 o'clock, moving rapidly anti-clockwise to 7 o'clock. This means a fast turn to the left.<BR>
   The CDI can also flip from one side to the other, e.g. again pic <A href="javascript: popup_screen('ballistics_wtpics/ballistics_sky34.htm')">34</A>-<A href="javascript: popup_screen('ballistics_wtpics/ballistics_sky35.htm')">35</A>. This just means that you entered a new curve, not that you spun 180° around.<BR>
   Cooler zones are not described in this walkthrough. Just take the ones that are already in your way. Avoid crashing, then you won’t need any coolers at all.<BR>
   On Skytown there are always four "grooves" or long narrow channels along the wall. E.g. at pic <A href="javascript: popup_screen('ballistics_wtpics/ballistics_sky02.htm')">02</A> they are at 12 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 6 o'clock and 9 o'clock. I follow a pattern that leads me most of the time along one of these lines. Think of it as being a white line in the middle of a dual carriageway. All of the time I'm either on the left or the right side of this line. The line itself ends in the lower left or the lower right corner of the screen.<BR>
   Some examples:<BR>
   For being on the left side of the line look at pic <A href="javascript: popup_screen('ballistics_wtpics/ballistics_sky03.htm')">03</A>-<A href="javascript: popup_screen('ballistics_wtpics/ballistics_sky06.htm')">06</A>, <A href="javascript: popup_screen('ballistics_wtpics/ballistics_sky51.htm')">51</A>-<A href="javascript: popup_screen('ballistics_wtpics/ballistics_sky52.htm')">52</A>.<BR>
   For being on the right side of the line look at pic <A href="javascript: popup_screen('ballistics_wtpics/ballistics_sky16.htm')">16</A>-<A href="javascript: popup_screen('ballistics_wtpics/ballistics_sky23.htm')">23</A>, <A href="javascript: popup_screen('ballistics_wtpics/ballistics_sky26.htm')">26</A>-<A href="javascript: popup_screen('ballistics_wtpics/ballistics_sky32.htm')">32</A>, <A href="javascript: popup_screen('ballistics_wtpics/ballistics_sky34.htm')">34</A>-<A href="javascript: popup_screen('ballistics_wtpics/ballistics_sky38.htm')">38</A>, <A href="javascript: popup_screen('ballistics_wtpics/ballistics_sky43.htm')">43</A>-<A href="javascript: popup_screen('ballistics_wtpics/ballistics_sky49.htm')">49</A>.<BR>
   For changing from one side of the line to the other: pic <A href="javascript: popup_screen('ballistics_wtpics/ballistics_sky06.htm')">06</A>-<A href="javascript: popup_screen('ballistics_wtpics/ballistics_sky08.htm')">08</A>.<BR>
   Sometimes I'm changing line, as in pic <A href="javascript: popup_screen('ballistics_wtpics/ballistics_sky23.htm')">23</A>-<A href="javascript: popup_screen('ballistics_wtpics/ballistics_sky26.htm')">26</A> I'm on the right lane. Then I'm moving left, switching to the right lane of the next line (the first line ends in the lower left corner. Then this line goes anti-clockwise until the next line is in the lower left corner).<BR>
   Another example: On pic <A href="javascript: popup_screen('ballistics_wtpics/ballistics_sky46.htm')">46</A>-<A href="javascript: popup_screen('ballistics_wtpics/ballistics_sky49.htm')">49</A> the right line of lights (ending in the lower left corner) is my new middle of the road, while I'm driving in the right lane. :)<BR>
   Of course this is just a rule of thumb. You will have to make minor adjustments to avoid obstacles. E.g. pic <A href="javascript: popup_screen('ballistics_wtpics/ballistics_sky26.htm')">26</A>-<A href="javascript: popup_screen('ballistics_wtpics/ballistics_sky32.htm')">32</A> is a frantic, but very small zig-zag.<BR><BR>
   <FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#A6755B"><B>How fast should I go?</B><BR><BR>
   The aim of this text and the following walkthrough besides learning the track is to reach the finish line as fast as possible. This means that high average speed is more important than topspeed.<BR>
   Hence, you race just as fast as you can while still having control of everything. The most important thing is not to crash into any obstacle. You're losing so much time this way - you need time to regain your speed, you waste valuable fuel that you will need on this upcoming long straight, you have to activate your cooler to prevent an explosion. This lost can't be compensated by a short spurt that will end in another crash.<BR>
   Stay smart - drive slower, but without any crashes. Your topspeed won’t be as high as before, but your track time will improve a lot.<BR>
   One example: It is possible to beat the AI opponents in ballistic difficulty setting without getting faster than Mach 1 once (topspeed: mach 0.997, avg. speed: mach 0.875).<BR><BR>
   <FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#A6755B"><B>What speeder setup should I use?</B><BR><BR>
   The speeder setup at the beginning is already a good choice.<BR>
   Seat: I recommend the I-Profiler - it’s simply the fastest. If you don’t want to spend 105.000$ take the S-Profiler.<BR>
   Engine: Stick to the ox ii until you can afford the n203.<BR>
   Front: Wavebreaker.<BR>
   Cooler: The cooler is really a matter of taste. Heat generation won't become a problem in most cases. Take one with high durability and good cooling. I like the n2v20.<BR>
   Speeder setup used for the screenshots: n203 / I-profiler / Airvent 4 / Wavebreaker.<BR><BR>
   <FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#A6755B"><B>The Daredevil Rule</B><BR><BR>
   Always press the standard acceleration button. The booster is normally employed if not stated otherwise. The cooler is never used once.<BR><BR>
