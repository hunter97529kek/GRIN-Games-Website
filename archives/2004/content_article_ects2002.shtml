   The GRIN stand was constantly filled with curious gamers and journalists that wanted to try what obviously was a gorgeuos game - the twelve flatscreens shared by four test stations and a huge plasma screen made sure no one made any mistakes about the visual strenght in the game.<BR><BR>
   Those who took the chance and played the game also found the controls being surprisingly easy to learn, even though they were put in charge of both a car and its free moving turret.<BR><BR>
   &quot;Have you learnt to use the SHIFT key?&quot; was the mantra of the show, constantly repeated by the GRIN staff on set.<BR><BR>
   These men in black, dressed in the latest piece of GRIN fashion - the "BANDITS - Phoenix Rising" T-shirt, were always ready to give a helping hand and give instruction whenever someone kept driving into the walls, give answers whenever someone wondered when the game is due release or give CPR whenever someone had a heart attack because of exposure to the shocking overall coolness of the game.<BR><BR>

   It was three days of hard work, promoting a game that had already been a year of hard work, but we are proud of the final product and it was absolutely great to see people enjoy it.<BR><BR>
   We would like to thank Mike Drummelsmith and Matrox for the support and hardware - the Parhelia Surround Gaming setups on the test stations sure generated a whole lot of attention and gave all the on site testers of BANDITS more visual glory than they could chew on.<BR><BR>
   Of course, we would also like to thank all of you who visited the stand; gamers, journalists and publishers - thanks for the your shown interest and feedback, but most of all; huge thanks for just giving us a chance to show you our game - we hope you like playing it as much as we liked making it!<BR><BR>
   ...and don't forget to use the Shift key!<BR><BR><BR>
