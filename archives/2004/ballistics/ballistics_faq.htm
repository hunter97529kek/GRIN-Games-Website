   <FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#A6755B"><B>This is a short FAQ from GRIN on the Ballistics&#153; title</B><BR><BR>
   First off: <I>Always run Ballistics&#153; on updated 3D graphics card drivers and make sure have installed the latest <A href="ballistics_patch1.htm">Ballistics Patch</A>.</I><BR><BR>
   <B>Q</B> My frame rate is not bad but sometimes it staggers, is there anything I can do?<BR>
   <B>A</B> Yes we found that this happens when using motherboards with a VIA chip. To fix this problem go to <A href="http://www.viatech.com" target="_blank">www.via.com</A> and download the 4-in-1-drivers that solves AGP port issues.<BR><BR>
   <B>Q</B> I try to run my game on EXTREME detail level but it aborts me on loading the track.<BR>
   <B>A</B> This can happen if you use a 3D Card that does not support Pixel and Vertex shaders or can't emulate them. The EXTREME geometry detail level is for high end hardware set ups.<BR><BR>
   <B>Q</B> What's the best in game option to increase frame rate?<BR>
   <B>A</B> Go to the Game Options and turn down the Geometry Level. If you have low RAM or a card with only 16 Mb we recommend trying the lower level of "Texture Detail" too. Also turn "Force Speeder Skins" ON and you will find your frame rate increased.<BR><BR>
   <B>Q</B> I got a decent setup with a T&L based card - what's the best thing to upgrade for more flow in Ballistics&#153;?<BR>
   <B>A</B> RAM is the best and cheapest way. Adding only 64Mb more to your 128Mb set up will increase the flow a lot.<BR><BR>
   <B>Q</B> I'm going to a LAN party and want to bring my PILOT profile with me, can I ?<BR>
   <B>A</B> Yes. Simply copy your Ballistics.sav from your "Savegames" directory and paste it into the same when you arrive at the LAN party.<BR><BR>
   <B>Q</B> I want to have my own Skin on the Pilot and Speeder, can I?<BR>
   <B>A</B> Yes you can. Either you edit the .dds file in the Skins directory if you have a .dds plug-in or you download the <A href="skins/originalskinpilot.tga">RawPilotSkin.tga</A> and <A href="skins/originalskinspeeder.tga">RawSpeederSkin.tga</A> from us and place it in the directory. You can have as many skins you want in the directories.<BR><BR>
   <B>Q</B> What do you recommend to use if I don't want to run with mouse and keyboard?<BR>
   <B>A</B> We recommend a gamepad in front of everything else; for Ballistics&#153; a joypad is much faster than a joystick.<BR><BR>
   <B>Q</B> I want to go SUPERSONIC - what's your tip?<BR>
   <B>A</B> Low mass and high booster gain..... :)<BR><BR>
   <B>Q</B> When I hit speeds beyond the soundbarrier the textures start to go backwards, is this right or am I seeing things?<BR>
   <B>A</B> This is just like a wheel on a car spinning at very high speed. The eye can't handle the updates and it looks like things start to go backwards. Proves you're right up there with the serious Speed Freaks!<BR><BR>
