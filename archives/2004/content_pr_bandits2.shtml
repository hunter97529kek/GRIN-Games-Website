  <TD align="left" valign="top" width="535"><DIV align="center"><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#C7BDB3"><B>US publisher Tri Synergy has acquired the license for PAN Vision's acclaimed action title &quot;BANDITS - Phoenix Rising&quot; for the North American market</B></FONT><BR><BR>
   <FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#C7BDB3"><I>Tri Synergy expects to release the game December this year</I></DIV><BR>
   <DIV align="justify"><B>STOCKHOLM, Sweden, November 4th, 2002</B> &quot;BANDITS - Phoenix Rising&quot; is to be released in North America this December.<BR><BR>
   Tri Synergy and the rest of the software world first learned about &quot;BANDITS - Phoenix Rising&quot; at the ECTS show in London earlier this autumn, leading to the contract for North America being signed this week.<BR>
   <I>Tamra Nestler, President & CEO of Tri Synergy</I>, commenting on the titles shown at ECTS said:<BR><BR>
   - In my opinion the most promising title on exhibit at ECTS this year was a well-kept secret called &quot;BANDITS - Phoenix Rising&quot;.<BR>
   I predict that &quot;BANDITS&quot; will take the US market by storm and be the sleeper hit to come out of ECTS.<BR><BR>
   - Tri Synergy is a medium size player in this important market and we feel they can give &quot;BANDITS - Phoenix Rising&quot; the necessary focus for a succesful North American launch, says <I>Peter Levin, CEO of PAN Vision</I>.<BR>
   We are confident that Tri Synergy is big enough to make a broad impact, yet small enough to move quickly and get &quot;Bandits - Phoenix Rising&quot; the attention it deserves at the trade and retail levels. &quot;Bandits - Phoenix Rising&quot; has already proven its appeal and demand in the Nordic region with a highly succesful retail launch last month.<BR><BR>
   - Tri Synergy is thrilled to be the North American publisher of &quot;BANDITS - Phoenix Rising&quot;.<BR>
   &quot;BANDITS&quot; is by far the most exciting vehicular combat racing game to enter the PC gaming arena in years! says <I>Shane Nestler, Executive Vice President of Tri Synergy</I>.<BR>
   Top notch graphics, amazing physics, an incredible soundtrack and fast paced, nonstop action are sure to make &quot;BANDITS&quot; a great success in North America and the rest of the world.<BR><BR>
   - We trust PAN Vision and TriSynergy to do an excellent job publishing &quot;BANDITS&quot; in the US together, says <I>Bo Andersson, CEO of Grin Inc</I>, the developer of the game.<BR>
   We know we have geared up with a great title, it will be exciting to see what it can do in the field.<BR><BR>
