   Ballistics&#153; is the Formula One of the future. Needless to say Ballistics&#153; is for the extreme speed enthusiasts. Maximizing the use of the very latest 3D cards <br>GRIN has created a game that is furiously fast and sweet to your eyes.<BR><BR>
   <B>The GAME</B><BR><BR>
   Ballistics&#153; takes place during mans next century. Technology and increasing <br>demand for hazardous entertainment has born a new form of racing. The Ballistics&#153; pilots run their hover bikes on magnetic fields inside a track that <br>allows full 360º movement. The races take place in many different settings; all <br>with their own unique design concept and environment, but all shaped to breed the speed.<BR><BR>

   <B>The World of Ballistics&#153;</B><BR><BR>
   The year is 2090 and mankind has reached a high tech society where diseases are gone and almost everyone lives a very good life economically. The world is simply a stable place.<BR><BR>
   But when times are calm and money is present people always start to search for entertainment to fill their everyday lives with. Extreme sports have developed and Ballistics&#153; is one of the bigger ones. You are one of the contenders. You are a Ballistics&#153; Pilot, ready to throw yourself headstrong into the most awesome speed sensation to date! You are going Ballistics&#153;!<BR>
   The Ballistics&#153; races have evolved from the Formula One races. The Ballistics&#153; pilots are trained from their teens and using electronic enhancers their reflexes are much faster than any ordinary humans. To withstand the extreme g-forces they also replace some of their skeleton with titanium. Wearing g-suits like today’s fighter pilots they set out to race in these insane speed fests in their hunt for fame and fortune.<BR>
   Not only do you race through high tech scenarios, as a pro league pilot you get to travel the world and compete with other daredevils in the most spectacular <br>tracks ever built. Rushing through settings such as the Belize jungle, Grand <br>Canyon the city centre of future Huston you are in for some serious action and challenge. The tracks are built up using tunnels that allow a racing ground that is curved and twisted in almost any direction. The Pilots <br>who race in these tunnels are all using Speeders.<BR>
   Speeders are high tech hover bikes with a magnetic repel unit keeping them floating in the air when inside the track. To be able to keep the Speeders floating a magnetic field has been generated close to the track walls. This magnetic field, called the MF by some, will keep the speeder in the air or if the pilot chooses to it will keep the Speeder attached just a few decimetres from the wall - hovering.<BR>
   Being a Speeder pilot has its pros and cons. The cons being high speed impacts with concrete walls or obstacles, the pros involving fame and the good old hard cash for you performance. Each race pays good and you do deserve that for <br>throwing yourself into this furious racing grind. Pilots are not only awarded price money for their position after each race but also for style. A Daredevil move at 900 km/h can render some serious money if preformed in the right spot in the track.<BR>

   <B>Gameplay</B><BR><BR>
   Players control their Speeders by two systems. One where the Speeder attaches to the tunnel's inner wall magnetic field. In this mode the Speeder can strafe 360 degrees around the track still keeping its direction. The benefit is more control in curves and when tackling and overtaking opponents.
   The second control system is enabled by hitting the detach switch on the dashboard and release from the magnetic field. This will enable free motion; loop, roll and turn. The free movement will allow the pilot to reach certain positions in the track that allow bonus power ups or just price money. The downside of free movement is of course that it is harder to control and can cause crashing at high speeds. The free movement should be avoided and only used for short periods. Colliding with obstacles will knock the player into detach mode and it is imperative for him to get back on track and attach.<BR>
   The game play is built upon almost limitless speed and the avoidance of in track obstacles and the collecting of booster fuel and using of cooler zones that are placed along the course. All this while opponents tries to overtake and ram you into the tunnel walls in their attempts to snag the first place. Classy moves and extreme courage is rewarded with money.<BR>

   <B>Graphics and Effects</B><BR><BR>
   Using GRINs own Diesel Engine Ballistics&#153; render from 20,000 to 110,000 thousand polygons in the view port. Adding up to a total sum of over 1500 textures in seven tracks with fully animated environments and light effects, you have a stunning piece of entertainment. Effects like masked chrome, real time lights, reflections, morphing animations, bump mapping, sparks, explosions, rain, snow and fog are all well balanced together with the 3D sound to give the gamer a nice run for money spent on new 3D hardware.<BR><BR>
   <B>Pilots & Speeders</B><BR><BR>
   To be able to stand the extreme g-force pilots are using gel filled lungs and pressure suits. The player is able to buy upgrades and modifications to the speeder. The upgrade system is an important part of the game play and affects the steering and features of the Speeder.<BR>
   Running different leagues and snatching winning positions will render cash. Between races this is used for purchase of new parts and for buying your way into better leagues. No Speeder is the best; it is all about finding the right setup for you. This extends the lifetime a lot, specially the multiplayer mode.<BR><BR>

   <B>Speeder Upgrades</B><BR><BR>
   Parts for the speeders come in many different brands each with it’s own good and bad features. The parts are grouped as follows:<BR><BR>
   <B>Chassis</B> - This part is the look. As well as making room for chromed finish and decals this part set the amount of damage a Speeder can take before breaking down or exploding.<BR><BR>
   <B>Engines</B> - A broad range of engines gives the pilots plenty of choice when it comes to horsepower and heat. Besides pulling all the weight of the gear the engine produces a lot of heat. Depending on the combination of parts heat will eventually melt or blow the Speeder to pieces. This is something every pilot has to consider; the balance between heat and acceleration. Too much heat will cause explosions you don’t want to be near.<BR><BR>
   <B>Coolers</B> - Bulky but efficient, these units provide the pilot with help when on the verge of overheating. Working with either constant cooling or short bursts the pilot can fight heat levels and if skilled keep the acceleration at maximum through the race.<BR><BR>
   <B>Boosters</B> - These are the gadgets used for attaining speeds beyond the sound barrier. Boosters gush out heat - massive power kick in and fires the speeder like a bullet in a Ballistics&#153; range. Pilots must time the use with the right racing technique and really know their way around the track or else - get peeled down like wallpaper!<BR><BR>
